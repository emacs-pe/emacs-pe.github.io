This is a replacement for X-Symbol for Proof General.

Functions to display tokens that represent Unicode characters and
control code sequences for changing the layout.  Tokens are useful
for programs that do not understand a Unicode encoding.


Desirable improvements/enhancements

-- insert tokens via numeric code (extra format string), cf HTML
-- simplify: unify region and control settings?
-- simplify/optimise property handling
-- support multiple modes with mode-local configs at once
