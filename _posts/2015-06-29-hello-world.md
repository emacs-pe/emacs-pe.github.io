title: Yet another Emacs blog
---

I succumbed the temptation to start a Emacs blog. I plan to write
about things that I discover about Emacs and packages which I found
useful.

Currently uses [jekyll][] with the [scribble][] theme.

## Why [jekyll][] and not our beloved [org-mode][]?

You can [certainly][] [use][] [mode][] [org][] to write a blog but
you’ll end up handling manually most of the features that comes for
free with jekyll (rss, archive, pagination, etc).  I mainly choose
jekyll because it’s really easy to setup, and github pages offers a
painless hosting.
