title: Checking out github pull requests locally with magit
---

Github [offers the ref][] `/refs/pull` to download the pull requests
from a repository, this is really useful for reviewing changes,
testing locally, cherry picking, etc; and using it with [magit][]
makes the whole process really simple.

The following snippet automatically adds the refspec of `origin`
remote to the `.git/config` and when called interactively will ask you
for a remote and a local namespace for the refspec, this is useful
when you have a remote `upstream` and want to check its pull requests.

If you donâ€™t want that automatically adds a refspec in a repository,
you can change disable it with:

```
git config core.disableprref true
```

and for disabling it to the `origin` remote:

```
git config remote.origin.disableprref true
```

p.s. This feature is also available in [Stash][] but [not in bitbucket][].
